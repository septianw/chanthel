Introduction
=========================

Casebox is an open-source content management system. The codebase is Javascript/PHP (50% / 50%). The frontend is developed using `ExtJS5`_ from Sencha. MySQL database is used as a storage engine. All data is indexed in `SOLR`_ search engine for full-text searches, faceting, pivoting etc. If OpenOffice/LibreOffice is installed on the server, file previews can be generated for .docx, .pptx, .odt and other Office files.

Casebox is hosted at `GitHub`_. For production, use the ``master`` branch.

Latest development version is under ``devel`` branch.
